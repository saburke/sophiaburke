#  Dissertation Work (2014 - 2020)
## Project Focus
My PhD work centered on sub-arctic peatlands with a particular focus on methane (CH^4) emissions from peatland thaw ponds.

## Study Site
My main study site is Stordalen Mire, in northern Sweden, 200 km within the Arctic Circle. I used a combination of manual measurements, remote sensing (UAV imagery collection), and acoustical measurements to compile a seven year data set of ebullitive, or bubbling, measurements from these small ponds collected during the growing season (June - August).
