My PhD work centered on sub-arctic peatlands with a particular focus on methane (CH4) emissions from peatland thaw ponds.

My main study site is Stordalen Mire, in northern Sweden, 200 km within the Arctic Circle. I used a combination of manual measurements, remote sensing (UAV imagery collection), and acoustical measurements to compile a seven year data set of ebullitive, or bubbling, measurements from these small ponds collected during the growing season (June - August).
